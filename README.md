# Permissive Visibility

### What is this?

**Permissive field of view** is a line of sight algorithm for tile maps described in [Roguelike Vision Algorithms by Adam Milazzo](https://www.adammil.net/blog/v125_roguelike_vision_algorithms.html#permissive).

This is a modified port of the sample code in that article, as a GDExtension written in C++. It was developed for [Lancer Tactics](https://wick.itch.io/lancer-tactics).

### How do I use it?

Grab the precompiled binaries from the `bin/` folder, or follow the [usage guide in the GDExtension template](https://github.com/godotengine/godot-cpp-template) to compile from source.
